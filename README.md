How I Created This Project

1. Designed a modular architecture to ensure code reusability and scalability.


2. Defined the database schema and connected it to the application using MySQLdb.


3. Created Pydantic models for data validation and API request/response handling.


4. Implemented APIs for user management, book operations, and borrow requests.


5. Used FastAPI's built-in tools for easy documentation and testing via Swagger UI.
